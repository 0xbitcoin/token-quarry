# ERC20 Token Quarry


Deposit tokens in this smart contract in order to allow users to easily mine for them using Proof of Work.  Helps you perform a 'mining drop' instead of an air drop.  




An ERC20 token wallet which dispenses tokens via Proof of Work mining.
Based on recommendation from /u/diego_91

Anyone can deposit any ERC20 token in this contract and they will be locked inside.   0xBitcoin miners can submit their solutions to this contract (at the same time they submit their solutions to the 0xBitcoin contract) and they will then be rewarded with 5% of the ERC20 tokens of their choice which are stored in this contract.  This allows any ERC20 token to be merge mined with 0xBTC.
